<b> GeneralPOS </b>

Forget about those days when retailers used a cash register to process sales after which the data was transferred to accounts and 
stock list.Today, with the help of a General POS software you can simplify your billing, promotions, returns and much more.
A full-featured enterprise POS system that can handle sales monitoring and reporting, analytics, inventory tracking,
mobile connectivity, customer data management, employee management, and robust integrations.

Objectives of GeneralPOS:

1. Billing and order processing:

A point of sale system must have the basic functionality of billing and order processing. 
It should be able to bill orders by scanning items and capturing different payment modes.
It has the capability to generate order invoice, reprint and email to end customer along with adding the discount, 
customer details, additional remarks and salesman’s name to an order.

2. Sales monitoring and reporting

The point of sale system must be able to generate a robust report on sales result. It should be able to report hourly, daily, weekly, 
monthly and yearly takings and outgoings so that the merchants can easily 
understand the overall success of their business. Sales trends such as seasonal demand in products,
forecast on the basis of sales trends, insights on unnecessary product overspend, and information relating 
to stock management are some of the features of an advanced POS reporting module.

3. Inventory and stock management

A POS system’s inventory management module must provide complete visibility and accountability at store level at all times.
The system should provide a view of lot-wise inventory, SKU transaction history about ‘in’, ‘out’ and ‘within’ movements of any SKU, 
and inbound & outbound inventory.
It should be able to make stock adjustments i.e. increase/decrease stock while viewing inventory and capture the reason for 
stock adjustments.
